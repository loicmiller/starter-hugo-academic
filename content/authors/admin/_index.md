I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the SOTERN team at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en), under the [Cyber CNI](https://cybercni.fr/) chair.

I am presently investigating the use of distributed ledgers in collaborative cybersecurity systems, as well as more theoretical aspects of the blockchain.
I also worked on data leak prevention in multi-party workflows, complexity proofs on hypergraphs, in addition to the security of the BGP protocol.

I have obtained my PhD from the [University of Strasbourg](https://en.unistra.fr/), where I worked in the [_Networks_ Team](http://icube-reseaux.unistra.fr/fr/index.php/Accueil) of the ICube laboratory.
